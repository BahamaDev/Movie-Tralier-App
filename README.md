## Developer's Notes:
Ahhhh React JS! How I am growing to love thee and understand thee more and more.  

This MVP was a great exploration of some of the core components and features of React. Though there are many similar builds around I used this project to test my growing understanding of React and intentionally did not follow any templates or refer to any tutorials of similar builds.  Twas a good challenge!
